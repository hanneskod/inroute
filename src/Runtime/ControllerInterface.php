/**
 * Defines a controller class
 *
 * ControllerInterface is an empty interface. Its sole purpose is to identify
 * controller classes at compile time.
 *
 * Pulic methods annotated with the `@route` annotation of the controller are
 * treated as individual routes through the application. There are no fixed
 * rules concerning how these routes should be group together. It is recommended
 * however to let each class represent a web resource, and let the individual
 * routes represent actions on the resource (eg. GET, POST and so forth).
 *
 * A controller/route is executed with an Environment as argument. The
 * environment can be used to access the inroute runtime. Se the Environment
 * class for more information.
 *
 * The controller/route may write directly to standard output. A more testable
 * approch is to let the controller retrun some kind of value object. The
 * return value of the controller will be the return value of the router.
 *
 * If the controller/route concludes that control should be passed to next
 * executable route a NextRouteException can be thrown.
